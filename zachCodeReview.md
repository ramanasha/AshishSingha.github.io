# Code Review

1. Create a .gitignore file and add it to your base directory
* The .gitignore file is a must for any github project. It is not a good practice to include the library files (such as jquery.bxslider.js and bootstrap.css)
* https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

2. Have someone proofread some of your text as there are a few minor grammatical mistakes.

3. Try to externalize the javascript that you have at the bottom of your body in 'index.html' so that that script tag links to a seperate javascript file that contains your code

## Remarks
These were some of the things that I saw that can help you improve your code. You are doing a great job man - keep working on your projects. Get your projects better and better so that some of the more 'fluff' projects that are really simple can fall by the wayside. In your portfolio try to shoot for 3-4 really well done and detailed projects that look very appealing to the eye. Great job!
